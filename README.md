## Create (credit to 2Naato)
 - Andesite Alloy
 - Brass
 - Shadow Steel: enchantable
 - Refined Radiance: very enchantable

## Enderite
 - Enderite: major modules grant the Void Floating improvement, which keeps the tools from falling into the Void.

## Ice & Fire
 - Dragon and sea serpent scales can be used to wrap hilts, grips, and handles. All will improve durability, damage, swing speed, and reduce negative item effects such as Ender Reverb and Blazing.
 - Fire dragon scales give better damage and reduce Blazing more
 - Ice dragon scales give better durability
 - Lightning dragon scales give better swing speed
 - Sea serpent scales are inferior to dragon scales and do not excel in any particular area
 - Currently I have no intention to add dragonsteel (it requires significantly more work to add new item effects).
 - Dragonbone and witherbone are compatible with Tetra by default.

## Outer End
 - Azure wood
 - Crystal shards can be socketed: rose for damage, mint for efficiency, cobalt for Intuit (like lapis).

## Quark
 - Slate
 - Limestone
 - Marble: not very hard, but quite durable.
 - Jasper: nearly iron in stats.
 - Voidstone: more durable than obsidian, with better Integrity use, and nearly as good everywhere else.
 - Myalite: better than iron at mining and harder than diamond, but not as light or durable.

## Unearthed
 - Gabbro
 - Rhyolite
 - Kimberlite
 - Phyllite
 - Slate
 - Quartzite
 - Marble
 - Schist
 - Limestone

## Wyrmroost
 - Blue Geode: roughly equal to diamond. Can be socketed.
 - Red Geode: better than Blue. Can be socketed for benefits between Diamond and Pristine Diamond.
 - Purple Geode: better than Red. Can be socketed for benefits better than Pristine Diamond. Highest tool level in the game.
